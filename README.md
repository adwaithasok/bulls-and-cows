# Bull-Cow Game

## Description

The **Bull-Cow Game** is a fun, interactive game where players each choose a secret 4-digit number. The digits in each number must be distinct. Players take turns guessing each other's number. After each guess, the opponent will provide feedback in the form of *bulls* and *cows*:

- **Bull**: A digit that is correct and in the right position.
- **Cow**: A digit that is correct but in the wrong position.

### Example:

- **Secret number**: `4271`
- **Opponent's guess**: `1234`
- **Answer**: `1 Bull and 2 Cows`
    - Bull: The digit `2` is in the correct position.
    - Cows: The digits `4` and `1` are correct but in the wrong positions.

## Features

- **2-Player Mode**: Each player selects a secret 4-digit number and takes turns guessing.
- **Bull and Cow Feedback**: After each guess, players receive feedback in the form of bulls and cows, helping them narrow down the correct number.
- **Valid Number Entry**: Ensures that players enter valid 4-digit numbers with unique digits.
- **Game Progression**: Players continue guessing until one of them guesses the opponent's number correctly.
  
## How to Play

1. **Choose a secret number**: Each player picks a secret 4-digit number with no repeating digits.
2. **Take turns guessing**: On each turn, try to guess your opponent's number.
